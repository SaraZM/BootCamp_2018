# BootCamp_2018

This is the code and the data needed for the QLS Course Bootcamp for an introduction to R.


### Prerequisites

It would be useful to install Rstudio (you can download it here https://posit.co/) since all the code was initially developed with that tool.

## What is in here

The BootCamp_2018.Rmd file contains a brief introduction to some simple commands in R, it also contains the instructions for the project and some additional resources.
The .csv files contain all the information that you might want/need for your project.
The main goal for this project is to take historical data from other World Cups and predict who would have won each match in the last World Cup. Have fun!


## More information

The R version used to write this code is 3.4.2
